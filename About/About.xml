--- Original Description ---
not doing anymore updates for any rimworld mods, please feel free to update and upload the mods on steam, i dont mind.

"advanced powergeneration"

a light in every corner, an extra workbench there, maybe another cooking stove - wondering where your power went?

- a simple try to add some "late game" power supply
- no maintenance/refueling, just place it and get the power.

Details:

Adds advanced windturbine, advanced solar panels, advanced geothermal and advanced nuclear power plants. All must be researched before they can be build. Research is dependend on vanilla research (electricity/solar/geothermal). placement restrictions for wind/geothermal still apply.

power output:
- advanced windturbine: max 6k (double normal windturbine)
- advanced solar: max 3,4k (double normal solar)
- advanced geothermal: 7,5k
- nuclear power: 20k
- adv watermill: 2,2k

research:
- all are tech level spacer and need a higtech research bench and the multianalyzer

research "tree":

electricity research -&gt; advanced winturbine research
solar research -&gt; advanced solar panels
geothermal research -&gt; advanced geothermal research -&gt; advanced nuclear power research

The research is currently using the positions after the ship research in the tree (x 13 and 14). I could not get the placement to work how i wanted it to in the vanilla tree. This might cause/is causing some strange looking connection lines in the research tree and might "conflict" with other mods. Currently a bit unsure if/how to fix that.

as of a16 the buildings have weight:
adv wind: 500
adv solar: 450
adv geo: 1000
adv nuclar: 1250

costs:
calculated from the vanilla values of the current alpha over the wealth/powe values. the dropbox folder has an openoffice table with the stats+calc.
